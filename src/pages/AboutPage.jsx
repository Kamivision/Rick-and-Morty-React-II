            <h1>About Rick n Morty</h1>
            <p>
                Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez, a cynical mad scientist, and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures that take place across an infinite number of realities, often traveling to other planets and dimensions through portals and on Rick's flying saucer. The general concept of Rick and Morty relies on two conflicting scenarios: domestic family drama and a misanthropic grandfather dragging his grandson into hijinks.

                Roiland initially voiced Morty and Rick with Chris Parnell as Jerry, Spencer Grammer as Summer and Sarah Chalke as Beth also star. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival Harmon co-founded. A seventh season was confirmed as part of a long-term deal with Cartoon Network that ordered 70 new episodes, and by 2024 renewed the series through a twelfth season.

               Adult Swim cut ties with Roiland in 2023 amid allegations of domestic abuse and recast his roles with Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden taking over for the seventh season premiering in October 2023 and the eighth season in May 2025.
